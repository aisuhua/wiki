# Base64

Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. 
The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding. 
Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. 
Three 8-bit bytes (i.e., a total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.
